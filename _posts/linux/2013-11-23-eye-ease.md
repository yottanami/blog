My favorite IDE is Emacs and It`s always open on my laptop, The color theme of IDE is very important  for eyes.I was searching about eye friendly colors in Emacs that I find [this](http://gnuemacscolorthemetest.googlecode.com/svn/html/index-el.html)

;; Set my favorite color theme(require ‘color-theme)(color-theme-initialize)(color-theme-aalto-light)
